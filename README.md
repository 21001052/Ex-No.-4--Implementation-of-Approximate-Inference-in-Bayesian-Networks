# Ex-No.4 Implementation of Approximate Inference in Bayesian Networks
## Aim : 
   To construct a python program to implement approximate inference using Gibbs Sampling.

## Algorithm:

Step 1: Bayesian Network Definition and CPDs:<br>
(i) Define the Bayesian network structure using the BayesianNetwork class from pgmpy.models.<br>
(ii) Define Conditional Probability Distributions (CPDs) for each variable using the TabularCPD class.<br>
(iii) Add the CPDs to the network.<br>
Step 2: Printing Bayesian Network Structure:<br>
(i) Print the structure of the Bayesian network using the print(network) statement.
Step 3: Graph Visualization:<br>
(i)Import the necessary libraries (networkx and matplotlib).<br>
(ii)Create a directed graph using networkx.DiGraph().<br>
(iii)Define the nodes and edges of the graph.<br>
(iv)Add nodes and edges to the graph.<br>
(v) Optionally, define positions for the nodes.<br>
(vi) Use nx.draw() to visualize the graph using matplotlib.<br>
Step 4: Gibbs Sampling and MCMC:<br>
(i) Initialize Gibbs Sampling for MCMC using the GibbsSampling class and provide the Bayesian network.<br>
(ii)Set the number of samples to be generated using num_samples.<br>
Step 5: Perform MCMC Sampling:<br>
(i)Use the sample() method of the GibbsSampling instance to perform MCMC sampling.<br>
(ii)Store the generated samples in the samples variable.<br>
Step 6: Approximate Probability Calculation:<br>
(i) Specify the variable for which you want to calculate the approximate probabilities (query_variable).<br>
(ii)Use .value_counts(normalize=True) on the samples of the query_variable to calculate approximate probabilities.<br>
Step 7:Print Approximate Probabilities:
(i) Print the calculated approximate probabilities for the specified query_variable.<br>
